Hi ! I made a music player for myself as a part of practice .
This is completely made with Vue.js .

All the media it has is mine religious poems , you can add songs as per your convenience .
It has a huge scope of improvement in aspects of Design and Funtioning .
I did it to do some practice and apply my little knowledge of JS.

So ,anyone who wants to take it and proceed with it are welcomed to do so ,
  and I am open to contributions too.

## How to run

1. git clone `https://github.com/MohammadHirani/musicplayer`
2. cd `musicplayer`
3. npm run serve

## Enhancements

Here are the things which I am trying to improve

1. To add a progress bar which shows total duration of music , and current & remaining minutes
2. To add some dynamic bg as per music .
3. More Coming soon ! Suggestions are most welcomed :)
